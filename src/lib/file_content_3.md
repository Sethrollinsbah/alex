# Affordable COBRA Alternatives: Short-Term, Medicaid, and ACA Plans

COBRA insurance allows individuals to continue their employer-sponsored health coverage for a limited time after leaving their job. However, there are other alternatives that may offer more affordable or better-suited coverage. These alternatives include plans through the Health Insurance Marketplace, short-term health insurance, Medicaid, or a new employer's plan. It’s important to explore all your options and evaluate your specific needs before making a decision.

## Why Consider Alternatives to COBRA?

COBRA insurance can be expensive, with premiums often higher than those of other coverage options. Additionally, COBRA coverage is limited to a set period—either 18 or 36 months—and the eligibility criteria can be restrictive. Exploring alternatives to COBRA may offer more affordable or longer-term options, ensuring continuous health insurance coverage.

## Choosing a Temporary Health Plan

Many individuals choose temporary health plans as a way to fill the gap in coverage until they transition to a new health insurance plan, such as through a new employer. This is particularly common for those who have recently left a job and are waiting for their next employer-provided health insurance to begin.

## Your Options

- **Temporary Health Insurance**: Costs for temporary plans vary depending on your age and state of residence. These plans typically provide coverage for a limited time.
- **Affordable Care Act (ACA) Plans**: ACA plans offer coverage for pre-existing conditions and are available through the Health Insurance Marketplace. They may be a great alternative to COBRA for those who need ongoing coverage.
- **Short-Term Plans**: These can be a more affordable option, though the coverage may be less comprehensive compared to traditional health insurance.
- **Medicaid**: For eligible low-income individuals and families, including some seniors and those with disabilities, Medicaid offers low-cost or even free health coverage.

## About Short-Term Plans

In certain states, obtaining short-term health insurance may require joining a professional organization. Some insurance providers may automatically enroll you in these organizations if applicable, depending on your location.
