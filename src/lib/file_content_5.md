### Important: Ending COBRA Is Not a Qualifying Event

###### Once you begin COBRA coverage, it serves as your health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Ending your COBRA coverage is not considered a qualifying life event that allows you to enroll in a new ACA health plan.

##### When Can You Switch from COBRA to ACA?

You can switch from COBRA to an ACA plan under the following circumstances:

- **During Federal Open Enrollment** (Nov 1 â€“ Jan 15)
- **When you are offered a new employer's group health plan**
- **If COBRA becomes unaffordable**, you may apply for state Medicaid or consider a short-term health insurance plan.
