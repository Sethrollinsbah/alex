# What Is COBRA?
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) was signed into law on April 7, 1986 by Ronald Reagan. COBRA allows former employees to continue their current health coverage after leaving their job, which ensures uninterrupted healthcare access and provides the same benefits while retaining the same doctors they had while employed. This law was designed to help individuals maintain health coverage during job transitions, providing a safety net for millions of Americans.

# How Does COBRA Work?
When a former employee chooses to opt in for COBRA, they agree to pay the full cost of their health insurance plan, including the portion their employer previously contributed, plus a 2% service fee. By opting in, they will be able to retain the same plan they had while employed, with the same network of doctors and coverage benefits.

# COBRA Qualifications
There are many ways for someone to qualify for COBRA. These include:

* Voluntary of involuntary loss of employment, which removes access to employer-sponsored health coverage

* A reduction in hours worked that results in the employee no longer being eligible for their employer's health insurance coverage

* A divorce that leads to the loss of health coverage previously provided through a spouse's employer-sponsored plan

* Death of a spouse, which results in the surviving spouse losing access to health coverage that was provided through the deceased spouse's employer

* Reaching the maximum age limit (which varies by state) to remain as a dependent on a parent's employer-sponsored health insurance plan

## Duration and Cost of COBRA

COBRA coverage is temporary, and can last between 18 and 36 months, depending on the reason for losing your previous coverage. COBRA coverage also typically costs double the price of your previous plan, and can reach up to 4 times the price of your previous plan! This makes COBRA coverage unaffordable for the average American worker, especially a worker who has their family covered under their employer plan. 

 ## Alternatives to COBRA

Considering COBRA's short duration of coverage, and extremely high price, most people who it is offered to seek out alternative options to prevent overpaying and ensure that them and their family are covered long term. The best alternatives for COBRA include Public Market (ACA) plans and Private Market plans.

Public Market plans are best suited for individuals with extremely low income, or poor health. These options offer minimal benefits with high out of pocket costs, but cannot deny you coverage for pre-existing conditions, and can protect you from bankruptcy in the case of a major hospitalization. 

Private Market plans are best suited for people in relatively good health, and have may exclude coverage for applicants who are very unhealthy. These options offer reduced rates with increased benefits and lower out of pocket costs, while still protecting you from bankruptcy in the case of a major hospitalization.
